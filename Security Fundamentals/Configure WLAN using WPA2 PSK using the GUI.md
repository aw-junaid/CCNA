Configuring a WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) using WPA2 PSK (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 with Pre-Shared Key) is typically done through the web-based graphical user interface (GUI) of your wireless router or access point. The exact steps may vary depending on the specific make and model of your router or access point. Here's a general guide that you can follow:

### Note: 
These instructions are a general guideline, and the steps might differ based on your specific router model. Refer to your router's documentation for accurate and model-specific instructions.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Access the Router's Web Interface:**
   - Open a web browser on a device connected to the router's network.
   - Enter the router's IP address in the address bar. Common addresses include "192.168.0.1" or "192.168.1.1." Check your router's manual for the correct IP address.

2. **Log In to the Router:**
   - Enter the administrator username and password. If you haven't changed these, use the default credentials provided in your router's documentation.

3. **Navigate to the Wireless Settings:**
   - Look for a tab or section related to "Wireless," "Wi-Fi," or "WLAN" in the router's GUI. The exact wording may vary.

4. **Enable Wireless (If Not Already Enabled):**
   - If wireless is not already enabled, find an option to enable the wireless network. This is usually a checkbox or toggle switch.

5. **Configure the Wireless Network:**
   - Look for a section where you can configure the wireless network settings. This may be labeled "Wireless Settings" or "Wi-Fi Settings."
   - Choose a Network Name (SSID) for your wireless network. This is the name that will be visible to devices when they search for available networks.

6. **Choose WPA2-PSK Security:**
   - Look for a "Security" or "Security Mode" option. Choose "WPA2-PSK" or "WPA2 Personal" from the security options.

7. **Enter the Pre-Shared Key (Password):**
   - Find the field for the Pre-Shared Key or Wi-Fi password. Enter a strong, secure passphrase. This is the password users will use to connect to the Wi-Fi network.

8. **Save or Apply Changes:**
   - After configuring the settings, find an option to save or apply changes. This may be labeled "Save," "Apply," or "Save Changes."

9. **Restart the Wireless Network (If Required):**
   - Some routers may require you to restart the wireless network for changes to take effect. Look for an option like "Restart," "Apply Changes," or "Reboot."

10. **Connect Devices to the WLAN:**
    - On your Wi-Fi-enabled devices, search for available networks and select the one with the SSID you configured. Enter the WPA2-PSK passphrase when prompted.

### Additional Tips:
- Use a strong and unique Pre-Shared Key (passphrase) for better security.
- Regularly update your Wi-Fi password to enhance security.
- Check for firmware updates for your router and apply them to ensure the latest security features and improvements.

Remember, the exact steps and terminology may vary based on your router's make and model. Always refer to your router's documentation for accurate and model-specific instructions.
