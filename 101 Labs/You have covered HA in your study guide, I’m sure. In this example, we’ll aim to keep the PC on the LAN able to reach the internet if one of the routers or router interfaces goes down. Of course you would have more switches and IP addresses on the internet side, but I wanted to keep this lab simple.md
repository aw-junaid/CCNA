High Availability (HA) in networking typically involves designing and implementing redundant systems to ensure continuous network operation, even in the event of component failures. In your example, the goal is to maintain internet connectivity for a PC on the LAN, even if one of the routers or router interfaces experiences an outage. While this example is simplified, it reflects a fundamental principle of HA: redundancy.

# Here's a general outline of how you might achieve High Availability in this scenario:

### Topology Description:

- **Components:**
  - Two routers (Router A and Router B) connected to the LAN.
  - Internet connectivity provided through both routers.
  - PC on the LAN that needs internet access.

- **Redundancy:**
  - Redundant connections from the LAN to both Router A and Router B.
  - Redundant connections from both routers to the internet.

### Configuration Steps:

1. **Router Redundancy:**
   - Implement a High Availability protocol or mechanism between Router A and Router B. This could involve technologies like High Availability (HSRP, VRRP, or GLBP) or routing protocols with fast convergence times (such as EIGRP or OSPF).

2. **Redundant LAN Connections:**
   - Ensure that the PC on the LAN has redundant connections to both Router A and Router B. This could involve using redundant switches or a switch with dual uplinks.

3. **Internet Redundancy:**
   - If possible, have redundant connections from both Router A and Router B to the internet. This could involve working with your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to establish redundant links.

4. **Load Balancing:**
   - Implement load balancing on the routers to distribute traffic between the redundant paths. This helps optimize the use of available links and ensures that both links are actively utilized.

5. **Failover Testing:**
   - Regularly test failover scenarios to ensure that if one router or interface goes down, traffic seamlessly fails over to the redundant path. This testing is crucial to verify the effectiveness of the HA setup.

### Considerations:

- **IP Addressing:**
  - Ensure proper IP addressing and routing configurations on both routers to facilitate smooth failover.

- **Monitoring and Alerting:**
  - Implement network monitoring tools to continuously monitor the status of routers, interfaces, and internet connections. Set up alerts for any issues or failures.

- **Documentation:**
  - Maintain comprehensive documentation that includes the HA design, IP addressing, routing configurations, and any special considerations.

- **Security:**
  - Implement security best practices, including access control lists (ACLs) and firewall rules, on both routers to ensure that redundancy doesn't compromise security.

- **Scalability:**
  - Design the HA solution to scale if the network grows. Consider future expansion and ensure that the HA design accommodates increased traffic and devices.

By implementing these steps, you create a resilient network that can withstand failures in routers or interfaces, providing continuous internet connectivity for the devices on the LAN. High Availability is a critical aspect of network design, especially in scenarios where downtime is not acceptable.
