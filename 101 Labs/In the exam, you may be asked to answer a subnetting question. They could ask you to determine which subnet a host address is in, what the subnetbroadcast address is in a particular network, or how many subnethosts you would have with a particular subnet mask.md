Subnetting is a fundamental skill in networking, and it's commonly tested in exams to assess an individual's understanding of IP addressing and subnetting concepts. Here are some common types of subnetting questions you might encounter:

1. **Identifying Subnet for a Host:**
   - Given an IP address and subnet mask, you may be asked to determine the subnet to which a specific host belongs. This involves understanding how subnet masks work and finding the network address.

   Example:
   - Host IP: 192.168.1.30
   - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192
   - Question: In which subnet is the host located?

2. **Determining Subnet/Broadcast Address:**
   - You might be asked to calculate the subnet and broadcast addresses for a given IP address and subnet mask.

   Example:
   - IP: 172.16.5.25
   - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.240
   - Question: What are the subnet and broadcast addresses for this host?

3. **Calculating Subnets and Hosts:**
   - Given a specific subnet mask, you could be asked to calculate the number of subnets and hosts per subnet.

   Example:
   - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192
   - Question: How many subnets and hosts per subnet are possible with this subnet mask?

4. **Variable-Length Subnet Masking (VLSM):**
   - In more advanced scenarios, questions may involve variable-length subnet masking, where different subnets within the same network have different subnet masks.

   Example:
   - Network: 192.168.10.0/24
   - Subnet 1: 30 hosts
   - Subnet 2: 10 hosts
   - Question: What are the subnet masks for Subnet 1 and Subnet 2?

5. **Subnetting Practice:**
   - General subnetting questions that involve breaking down larger networks into smaller subnets and allocating addresses accordingly.

   Example:
   - Given a network with IP address 192.168.0.0/24, subnet it into smaller subnets to accommodate different departments.

For each type of question, it's important to understand binary-to-decimal conversion, the relationship between subnet masks and CIDR notation, and how to calculate network, subnet, and broadcast addresses. Practicing subnetting with various examples will enhance your confidence and speed in answering subnetting questions during exams.
