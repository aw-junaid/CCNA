Named Access Control Lists (ACLs) are a way of creating and organizing access control lists with a user-defined name, providing a more human-readable and manageable way to understand and remember the purpose of each ACL. Named ACLs can be either standard or extended, just like numbered ACLs, but they offer additional benefits in terms of clarity and ease of management.

Here are some key advantages and considerations for named ACLs:

1. **Human-Readable Names:**
   - Named ACLs allow administrators to assign meaningful and descriptive names to each ACL, making it easier to understand the purpose and functionality of the access control rules.

2. **Organizational Convenience:**
   - When dealing with multiple ACLs on a router or switch, using named ACLs provides a more organized and structured approach. Each ACL can be named according to its specific role or the type of traffic it is designed to control.

3. **Easy to Remember:**
   - Human-readable names make it easier to remember the function of each ACL, reducing the likelihood of errors during configuration or troubleshooting.

4. **Flexibility in Ordering:**
   - Named ACLs allow flexibility in ordering, as you can easily insert or remove ACL entries without having to renumber the entire list. This is especially helpful when dealing with complex configurations.

### Example Named Extended ACL:

Here's an example of a named extended ACL:

```bash
Router(config)# ip access-list extended INTERNET_ACCESS
Router(config-ext-nacl)# permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 80
Router(config-ext-nacl)# permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 443
Router(config-ext-nacl)# deny ip any any
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router(config-if)# ip access-group INTERNET_ACCESS in
```

In this example, a named extended ACL named `INTERNET_ACCESS` is created to permit HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic from the source network `192.168.1.0/24` while denying all other IP traffic. The ACL is then applied to the incoming traffic on interface `GigabitEthernet0/0`.

Using named ACLs becomes particularly beneficial in larger and more complex network environments where multiple ACLs are needed, and clear organization and documentation are essential.

```bash
Router(config)# ip access-list standard MANAGEMENT_ACCESS
Router(config-std-nacl)# permit 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255
Router(config-std-nacl)# deny any
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
Router(config-if)# ip access-group MANAGEMENT_ACCESS in
```

In this example, a named standard ACL named `MANAGEMENT_ACCESS` is created to permit traffic from the management network `10.0.0.0/8` while denying all other traffic. The ACL is then applied to the incoming traffic on interface `GigabitEthernet0/1`.
