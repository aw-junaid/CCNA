Subnetting is a fundamental networking skill that is not only essential for exams but also for real-world scenarios, including technical interviews. Being proficient in subnetting allows you to efficiently allocate and manage IP addresses within a network, ensuring optimal utilization of resources.

Here's an example subnetting question along with the steps to solve it:

### Example Subnetting Question:

Given the IP address `192.168.10.0/24`, subnet it into smaller subnets to accommodate four different departments. The departments have the following requirements:

1. Department A: 30 hosts
2. Department B: 20 hosts
3. Department C: 10 hosts
4. Department D: 5 hosts

### Solution:

1. **Determine the Required Subnet Sizes:**
   - Department A needs 30 hosts, which requires a subnet size of at least 32 addresses (30 hosts + network address + broadcast address).
   - Department B needs 20 hosts, requiring a subnet size of at least 32 addresses.
   - Department C needs 10 hosts, requiring a subnet size of at least 16 addresses.
   - Department D needs 5 hosts, requiring a subnet size of at least 8 addresses.

2. **Allocate Subnet Sizes:**
   - Start subnetting with the largest required subnet (Department A) to minimize wasted addresses.

   - Allocate Subnets:
     - Subnet 1 (Department A): 192.168.10.0/27 (32 addresses)
     - Subnet 2 (Department B): 192.168.10.32/27 (32 addresses)
     - Subnet 3 (Department C): 192.168.10.64/28 (16 addresses)
     - Subnet 4 (Department D): 192.168.10.80/29 (8 addresses)

3. **Verify Subnet Sizes:**
   - Check that each subnet provides enough addresses for the respective departments.

4. **Write Down Subnet Details:**
   - Document the details of each subnet, including network address, subnet mask, usable IP range, broadcast address, and total addresses.

### Subnet Details:

1. Department A:
   - Network: 192.168.10.0/27
   - Usable Range: 192.168.10.1 to 192.168.10.30
   - Broadcast: 192.168.10.31
   - Total Addresses: 32

2. Department B:
   - Network: 192.168.10.32/27
   - Usable Range: 192.168.10.33 to 192.168.10.62
   - Broadcast: 192.168.10.63
   - Total Addresses: 32

3. Department C:
   - Network: 192.168.10.64/28
   - Usable Range: 192.168.10.65 to 192.168.10.78
   - Broadcast: 192.168.10.79
   - Total Addresses: 16

4. Department D:
   - Network: 192.168.10.80/29
   - Usable Range: 192.168.10.81 to 192.168.10.86
   - Broadcast: 192.168.10.87
   - Total Addresses: 8

### Conclusion:

Practicing subnetting regularly will improve your speed and accuracy in solving such questions. It's a valuable skill not only for exams but for real-world networking tasks and technical interviews. Understanding binary-to-decimal conversion, subnet mask manipulation, and CIDR notation is crucial for subnetting success.
