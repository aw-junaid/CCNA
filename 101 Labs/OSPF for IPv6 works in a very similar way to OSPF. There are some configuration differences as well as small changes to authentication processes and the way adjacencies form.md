OSPF for IPv6, also known as OSPFv3, operates in a manner very similar to OSPF for IPv4. However, there are some specific configuration differences and minor changes in processes when it comes to OSPFv3. Here are the basic steps for configuring OSPFv3:

### Basic OSPFv3 Configuration:

#### 1. **Enter Global Configuration Mode:**
   ```bash
   Router> enable
   Router# configure terminal
   ```

#### 2. **Enter OSPFv3 Configuration Mode:**
   ```bash
   Router(config)# ipv6 router ospf PROCESS_ID
   ```
   - Replace `PROCESS_ID` with the OSPFv3 process ID, which is locally significant.

#### 3. **Configure OSPFv3 on an Interface:**
   ```bash
   Router(config-rtr)# interface INTERFACE_NAME
   Router(config-if)# ipv6 ospf PROCESS_ID area AREA_ID
   ```
   - Replace `INTERFACE_NAME` with the name of the interface, `PROCESS_ID` with the OSPFv3 process ID, and `AREA_ID` with the OSPFv3 area ID.

#### 4. **Configure OSPFv3 Router ID (Optional):**
   ```bash
   Router(config-if)# ipv6 ospf PROCESS_ID router-id ROUTER_ID
   ```
   - Optionally, you can specify the router ID for the OSPFv3 process.

#### 5. **Exit Interface Configuration Mode:**
   ```bash
   Router(config-if)# exit
   ```

#### 6. **Configure OSPFv3 Authentication (Optional):**
   - OSPFv3 supports different authentication methods, including IPsec. Here's an example using a simple plaintext password:
   ```bash
   Router(config)# interface INTERFACE_NAME
   Router(config-if)# ipv6 ospf authentication-key PASSWORD
   ```

#### 7. **Verification Commands:**
   - After configuring OSPFv3, you can use the following commands to verify its operation:
   ```bash
   Router# show ipv6 ospf neighbor
   Router# show ipv6 ospf database
   ```

### Notes:

- **OSPFv3 Process ID:**
  - The OSPFv3 process ID is locally significant and is used to distinguish between different OSPFv3 processes on the same router.

- **Interface-Level Configuration:**
  - OSPFv3 configuration is done at the interface level. Each participating interface must be individually configured.

- **Router ID:**
  - A router ID is used to uniquely identify a router within an OSPFv3 area. If not configured manually, OSPFv3 will automatically select a router ID.

- **Authentication:**
  - OSPFv3 supports various authentication methods, including plaintext passwords, cryptographic authentication, and IPsec.

### Example Configuration:

Here's an example of basic OSPFv3 configuration:

```bash
Router(config)# ipv6 router ospf 1
Router(config-rtr)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0
Router(config-if)# ipv6 ospf 1 area 0
Router(config-if)# ipv6 ospf authentication-key PASSWORD
```

In this example, replace `1` with the OSPFv3 process ID, `GigabitEthernet0/0/0` with the interface name, and `PASSWORD` with the desired authentication key.

OSPFv3 provides efficient and scalable routing for IPv6 networks. The configuration, while similar to OSPF for IPv4, includes specific adjustments to accommodate IPv6 addressing and network requirements.
