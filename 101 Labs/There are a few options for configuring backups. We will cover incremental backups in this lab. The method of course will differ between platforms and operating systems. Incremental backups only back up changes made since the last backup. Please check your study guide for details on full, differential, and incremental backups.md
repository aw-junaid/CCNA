Incremental backups are a type of backup strategy that copies only the data that has changed since the last backup, whether it was a full backup or an incremental backup. This approach helps save storage space and time compared to full backups by focusing on the changes made since the last backup. Here's a general overview of incremental backups and how they fit into the broader backup strategy:

### Incremental Backup Overview:

1. **Full Backup:**
   - A full backup is a complete copy of all selected data. It serves as the baseline for subsequent backups.

2. **Incremental Backup:**
   - Incremental backups capture only the data that has changed since the last backup, whether it was a full backup or a previous incremental backup.

3. **Storage Efficiency:**
   - Incremental backups are more storage-efficient than full backups since they only store changes made since the last backup.

4. **Faster Backups:**
   - Incremental backups are generally faster than full backups because they focus on smaller amounts of data.

5. **Restore Process:**
   - To restore data, you would need the latest full backup along with all incremental backups made since that full backup. The full backup provides the baseline, and each subsequent incremental backup adds changes.

6. **Frequency:**
   - Incremental backups are often performed more frequently than full backups, especially in environments where daily changes are significant.

### Steps for Incremental Backups:

1. **Full Backup (Baseline):**
   - Perform an initial full backup to capture the entire dataset.

2. **Subsequent Incremental Backups:**
   - After the full backup, perform incremental backups regularly (e.g., daily). Each incremental backup captures changes made since the last backup.

3. **Restore Process:**
   - In the event of data loss, the restore process involves using the latest full backup along with all subsequent incremental backups to reconstruct the dataset.

### Backup Strategies:

1. **Full Backup:**
   - A full backup is a complete copy of all selected data and is typically performed periodically, such as weekly.

2. **Incremental Backup:**
   - Incremental backups capture changes made since the last backup and are performed more frequently, such as daily.

3. **Differential Backup:**
   - Differential backups capture changes made since the last full backup, regardless of previous differentials. They are a middle ground between full and incremental backups.

### Platform-Specific Configurations:

1. **Operating System:**
   - The method of configuring incremental backups may vary based on the operating system. Popular backup tools like `rsync` (Linux), Windows Backup (Windows), or third-party backup solutions offer options for incremental backups.

2. **Backup Software:**
   - Backup software solutions often have user-friendly interfaces for configuring backup schedules, including incremental backups. Consult the documentation of your specific backup software for detailed instructions.

### Considerations:

1. **Storage Requirements:**
   - While incremental backups save storage compared to full backups, it's essential to manage storage requirements, especially when retaining multiple incremental backups.

2. **Backup Retention Policy:**
   - Define a backup retention policy that determines how many incremental backups to keep and how frequently to perform full backups.

3. **Testing Restorations:**
   - Periodically test the restoration process to ensure that backups are functional and can be successfully restored.

4. **Security:**
   - Ensure that backup data is stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.
