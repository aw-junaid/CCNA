Configuring a pool of addresses for Network Address Translation (NAT) is a common practice, especially in scenarios where multiple devices within a private network need to share a limited set of public IP addresses. This is often achieved through a feature called Dynamic PAT (Port Address Translation) or Overload, where multiple private IP addresses are mapped to a smaller pool of public IP addresses with different port numbers.

Here's a basic example of how you might configure a pool of addresses for NAT on a router:

```bash
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router(config-if)# ip address 203.0.113.1 255.255.255.0
Router(config-if)# exit

Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
Router(config-if)# ip nat inside
Router(config-if)# exit

Router(config)# ip nat pool NAT_POOL 203.0.113.2 203.0.113.10 prefix-length 24
Router(config)# ip nat inside source list 1 pool NAT_POOL overload

Router(config)# access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
```

In this example:

- The router has two interfaces (`GigabitEthernet0/0` and `GigabitEthernet0/1`), where `GigabitEthernet0/0` is connected to the internet and `GigabitEthernet0/1` is connected to the private network (192.168.1.0/24).

- A NAT pool (`NAT_POOL`) is defined with a range of public IP addresses (`203.0.113.2` to `203.0.113.10`) that can be used to translate private IP addresses.

- The `ip nat inside source list 1 pool NAT_POOL overload` command specifies that NAT translation should be applied to traffic from the devices in the `192.168.1.0/24` network, and the `overload` keyword indicates that multiple private IP addresses can be mapped to the same public IP address using different port numbers.

- An access control list (ACL) is used (`access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255`) to identify the range of private IP addresses that should be subject to NAT.

This configuration allows multiple devices within the private network to share a pool of public IP addresses when accessing the internet.

It's worth noting that this example assumes the use of IPv4 addresses. In IPv6, the addressing scheme and NAT mechanisms are different.
