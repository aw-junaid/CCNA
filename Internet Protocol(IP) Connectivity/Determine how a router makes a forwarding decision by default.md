A router makes forwarding decisions based on the information in its routing table. The process of determining the best path for forwarding packets involves several key steps. Here is an overview of how a router makes a forwarding decision by default:

1. **Destination IP Address Lookup:**
   - When a router receives a packet, it examines the destination IP address of the packet.

2. **Routing Table Search:**
   - The router searches its routing table for an entry that matches the destination IP address of the packet. The routing table contains information about known networks and how to reach them.

3. **Longest Prefix Match:**
   - The router uses the Longest Prefix Match (LPM) algorithm to find the most specific match in the routing table. It selects the entry with the longest matching prefix (subnet mask).

4. **Next-Hop Determination:**
   - Once the best match is found, the router determines the next-hop IP address or the outgoing interface associated with that route in the routing table.

5. **Route Metric/Cost Evaluation:**
   - If there are multiple routes to the same destination, the router evaluates the metric or cost associated with each route. The route with the lowest metric is considered the best.

6. **Administrative Distance Comparison:**
   - If there are still multiple routes with the same metric, the router compares the administrative distance (AD) associated with each route. The route with the lowest administrative distance is chosen.

7. **Outgoing Interface Selection:**
   - Based on the selected route, the router determines the outgoing interface through which the packet should be forwarded to reach the destination.

8. **Forwarding the Packet:**
   - The router then forwards the packet out of the selected outgoing interface or to the next-hop IP address.

9. **ARP Resolution (if applicable):**
   - If the next-hop IP address is on a directly connected network, the router performs ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to resolve the next-hop IP address to the corresponding MAC (Media Access Control) address.

10. **Packet Forwarding:**
   - The packet is encapsulated in the appropriate data-link layer frame and forwarded to the next-hop device.

By following these steps, the router determines the best path for forwarding packets to their destination based on the routing information in its table. This process allows routers to make intelligent decisions about how to route traffic through a network, taking into account factors such as network topology, reachability, and routing protocol metrics.
