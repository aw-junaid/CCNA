A routing table is a key component of a network device, such as a router or a layer 3 switch, used to determine the next hop for forwarding packets to their destination. The routing table contains information about available routes, and each entry in the table typically includes various components. Here's how to interpret the key components of a routing table entry:

### 1. **Destination Network:**
   - **Description:** The destination network or subnet to which the route corresponds.
   - **Format:** It is represented using an IP address and subnet mask (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

### 2. **Next Hop:**
   - **Description:** The IP address of the next-hop router or next-hop gateway that the packet should be forwarded to in order to reach the destination network.
   - **Format:** It can be a specific IP address or a reference to an outgoing interface.

### 3. **Route Metric/Cost:**
   - **Description:** A metric or cost assigned to the route, indicating the desirability of using that route. It is used by routing algorithms to determine the best path.
   - **Lowest Metric Rule:** In general, the lower the metric, the better the route. Different routing protocols use different metrics.

### 4. **Network Interface:**
   - **Description:** The network interface through which the router can reach the next-hop IP address or the destination network.
   - **Format:** Physical or logical interface (e.g., GigabitEthernet0/1 or Vlan10).

### 5. **Route Type:**
   - **Description:** Indicates how the route was learned or added to the routing table. Different route types include directly connected routes, static routes, and routes learned through dynamic routing protocols.
   - **Common Types:** C (Connected), S (Static), R (RIP), D (EIGRP), O (OSPF), B (BGP).

### 6. **Administrative Distance (AD):**
   - **Description:** A numerical value representing the trustworthiness of a particular route source. Lower AD values indicate more trustworthy sources.
   - **Common AD Values:** Connected (0), Static (1), EIGRP (90), OSPF (110), RIP (120), BGP (20 for external routes, 200 for internal routes).

### 7. **Route Flags:**
   - **Description:** Flags associated with the route, providing additional information about its status or characteristics.
   - **Common Flags:**
     - C: Connected route
     - L: Locally assigned route
     - U: Route is up
     - H: Route is to a host (32-bit mask)
     - A: Route is an alias

### Example Routing Table Entry:

Consider the following routing table entry:

```
Destination     Next Hop       Metric   Interface   Type    AD   Flags
0.0.0.0/0        192.168.1.1     1       Gig0/0       S        1    U
```

- **Destination:** 0.0.0.0/0 (default route)
- **Next Hop:** 192.168.1.1
- **Metric:** 1
- **Interface:** GigabitEthernet0/0
- **Type:** Static route (S)
- **AD:** 1 (administrative distance)
- **Flags:** U (route is up)

This example entry represents a default static route pointing to the next-hop IP address 192.168.1.1 through the interface GigabitEthernet0/0.

Interpreting the routing table is essential for network administrators to understand how the router makes forwarding decisions and to troubleshoot network connectivity issues.
