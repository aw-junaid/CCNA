Configuring and verifying interswitch connectivity involves setting up connections between switches to enable communication between devices connected to different switches. This typically requires configuring trunk links to carry traffic for multiple VLANs. Below are the steps for configuring and verifying interswitch connectivity:

### Configuration Steps:

#### 1. **Configure Trunk Links on Switch1:**
   - Access the command-line interface (CLI) of Switch1.
   - Configure the interface connected to Switch2 as a trunk:

     ```bash
     Switch1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
     Switch1(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
     ```

#### 2. **Configure Trunk Links on Switch2:**
   - Access the CLI of Switch2.
   - Configure the interface connected to Switch1 as a trunk:

     ```bash
     Switch2(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
     Switch2(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
     ```

### Verification Steps:

#### 1. **Verify Trunk Configuration on Switch1:**
   - Check the status and configuration of the trunk link on Switch1:

     ```bash
     Switch1# show interfaces GigabitEthernet0/1 switchport
     ```

   - Confirm that the interface is in trunk mode and is allowed to carry the necessary VLANs.

#### 2. **Verify Trunk Configuration on Switch2:**
   - Check the status and configuration of the trunk link on Switch2:

     ```bash
     Switch2# show interfaces GigabitEthernet0/1 switchport
     ```

   - Confirm that the interface is in trunk mode and is allowed to carry the necessary VLANs.

#### 3. **Verify VLAN Information on Both Switches:**
   - Check the VLAN information on both switches:

     ```bash
     Switch1# show vlan
     ```

     ```bash
     Switch2# show vlan
     ```

   - Ensure that the VLANs are correctly configured on both switches.

#### 4. **Ping Between Devices on Different Switches:**
   - Connect devices to access ports on different switches in the same VLAN.
   - Ensure that devices can ping each other successfully.

#### 5. **Check Interswitch Connectivity:**
   - Ping between devices on different switches in different VLANs.
   - Verify that devices in different VLANs cannot ping each other due to VLAN segmentation.

### Troubleshooting Tips:

1. **Check Trunk Status:**
   - Use the `show interfaces trunk` command on both switches to verify the status of trunk links.

   ```bash
   Switch1# show interfaces trunk
   ```

   ```bash
   Switch2# show interfaces trunk
   ```

2. **Review VLAN Configurations:**
   - Ensure that the VLAN configurations (allowed VLANs on trunks, VLAN interfaces) match on both switches.

3. **Verify Physical Connections:**
   - Confirm that the physical connections between the switches are correctly established.

4. **Check VLAN Memberships:**
   - Use `show vlan` and `show interfaces switchport` to verify VLAN memberships on access ports.

   ```bash
   Switch1# show vlan
   Switch1# show interfaces switchport
   ```

   ```bash
   Switch2# show vlan
   Switch2# show interfaces switchport
   ```

By following these configuration and verification steps, you can ensure proper interswitch connectivity, allowing devices connected to different switches to communicate with each other through trunk links. Troubleshooting tips can help address any issues that may arise during the configuration process.
